# Fall-Prevention-Sensors-and-AI

## Abstract:

This project aims to develop a wearable sensor system integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) to prevent falls among elderly individuals. Utilizing the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller and the MPU6050 sensor module, the system monitors the user's Gyroscope and accelerometer values(balance and motion) in real-time. If a potential fall risk is detected, the system alerts the user through a buzzer. If a fall has been detected, the system sends the GPS location to a caretaker via Wi-Fi. By employing AI algorithms to analyze sensor data and predict fall risks, this project provides a proactive solution to enhance safety and independence for the elderly.
